# AML Project
This project takes the SAML-Dataset and builds decision tree models to identify fraudulent transactions.

After a brief exploratory analysis, where all covariates are examined, the analysis continues with the exploration of three models: one unsupervised and two supervised methods. The models that are analysed are: 
- Isolation Forest
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
